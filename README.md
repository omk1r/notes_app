# React Notes App

A simple notes application built using React. Users can create, view, and delete notes. Notes are stored locally using `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Create Note**: Allows users to create a new note by typing in the textarea and saving it.
- **View Notes**: Displays all existing notes with an option to delete each note individually.
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are stored in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring data persists across sessions.

## Components

### App Component (`App.js`)

The main component that renders the entire application.

- Manages the state of notes using `useState` and `setNotes`.
- Utilizes `useEffect` to sync notes with `localStorage` for persistence.
- Includes a Header component and renders the Notes component to display existing notes and provide functionality to create and delete notes.

### Notes Component (`Notes.js`)

Responsible for rendering existing notes and handling note deletion.

- Receives `notes` array and `setNotes` function as props.
- Maps through the `notes` array to render individual Note components.
- Provides functionality to delete a note by passing down `deleteNote` function to each Note component.
- Includes the CreateNote component at the end to allow users to create new notes.

### CreateNote Component (`CreateNote.js`)

Allows users to input new notes.

- Manages local state for the input text using `useState`.
- Provides a textarea for users to type new notes.
- Implements an "Add" button to save the note, which triggers `addNote` function to update `notes` state and clear the input field.

### Note Component (`Note.js`)

Represents an individual note.

- Receives `title`, `id`, and `deleteNote` function as props.
- Displays the note's title and provides a "Delete" button.
- Calls `deleteNote` function on button click to remove the note from the list.

### Header Component (`Header.js`)

Displays the header of the application.

- Shows a static header with the title "Notes".

## Styling

- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling components.
- Applies responsive design principles for better usability across different screen sizes.
